_Author's note: Recently, I received feedback from you about the quality of some of the applications on this list. I have tested a lot of these, but not all. If you have any problems with the apps, please: -> head to the dev page (if available) -> make an issue for the dev there -> make an issue here so that I can consider whether I should remove the app from the list. Remember : Every piece of software has it's own merits, so there will never be anything like "best app" or "selective list" here, thank you._
